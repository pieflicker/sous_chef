# sous_chef
small recipe repository.

Scoped down head_chef, which hopefully means I will be able and motivated to 
get it to a live version. Ideally very quickly. Must.Stop.Feature.Creep!

first
1 - recipes, listing and add <-- All functionally complete. Now adding some graphics (icons, header).
	Category tagging is the main new feature being implemented now (before adding photos, as 
	that means needing HDD space) .

soon
2 - Tagging by ingredient, searching, groups, 


3 - adding photos

maybe, we'll see.
4 -  ratings difficulty tags, search by ingredient
